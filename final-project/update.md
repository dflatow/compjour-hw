# Hilary Emails Project (Update)

## Road blocks
* NYT release on document cloud only had a subset of emails, and no meta-data (date, subject, to, from, etc...)
* state-dept release has meta-data but table in javascript

## Progress so far

* Parsed state-dept release of emails (not on document cloud)
* Now have all the meta-data for all released emails (296)
* Interesting that some document numbers are missing.
