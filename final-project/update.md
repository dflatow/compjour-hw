# Hilary Emails Project (Update)

## Road blocks
* NYT release on document cloud only had a subset of emails, and no meta-data (date, subject, to, from, etc...)
* state-dept release has meta-data but table in javascript

## Progress so far

* Parsed state-dept release of emails (not on document cloud)
* Now have all the meta-data for all released emails (296 emails, 800+ pages)
* Interesting that some document numbers are missing (maybe can say something about the emails that were not released)
* People have argued that there are "gaps" in the emails. I'd like to show (or disprove) this in a convincing way


## Mock-up
* For the mock-up, I want it to be easy to view the emails in the context of how events unfolded in Benghazi
* To do this I want to make an interactive google calendar chart where if you click on a date, those emails are pulled up
* Additionally, there will be flexibility to search for emails from particular people (e.g. Sidney Blumenthal)
